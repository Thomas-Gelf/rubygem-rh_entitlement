# RH Entitlement

This Ruby Gem helps to extract information (especially repository URLs) from
your RedHat entitlement certificates. This is helpful when dealing with multiple
RH subscriptions and the requirement to figure out which certificate / which ID
to use for what repository.

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile and run the `bundle` command to install it.

```ruby
gem "rh_entitlement"
```

**Requires Ruby 1.9.3 or later.**


## Usage

```ruby
require 'rh_entitlement'

cert = RhEntitlement::Certificate.new(
  File.read('/etc/pki/entitlement/9999999999.pem')
)
puts "Type: #{cert.type}"
puts cert.urls.list.join("\n")

puts "YES" if cert.urls.has? '/content/dist/middleware/jws/1.0/$basearch/os'
puts "YES" if cert.urls.has? [
  '/content/dist/rhel/server/6/$releasever/$basearch/ose-jbosseap/2.2/debug',
  '/content/dist/rhel/server/6/$releasever/$basearch/ose-jbosseap/2.2/os',
  '/content/dist/rhel/server/6/$releasever/$basearch/ose-jbosseap/2.2/source/SRPMS'
]

```
